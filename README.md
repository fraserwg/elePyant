# elePyant
elePyant (pronounced elephant) provides a set of tools for compressing netCDF files, and xarray Datasets and DataArrays. It works by rounding `meaningless' bits from data variables before saving the objects as compressed netCDF files. The type of compression is based on a talk my Milan in which he discusses how to fit an elephant in a fridge.
